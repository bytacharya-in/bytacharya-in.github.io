## Linux is for everyone.


Okay, let me start it like this. John is just some normal guy who likes to browse the internet, maybe watch movies, listen to some music or maybe make some presentations for the office, or do video calls and things like that. He has a friend named Dave who is a tech guy, uses Linux as his daily driver. John finds him using the command line whenever he is on his computer. John, out of curiosity decides to install the operating system his friend uses; even though he had to face some problems, he managed to install it.  But he is not able to make this OS as his daily driver. Immediately bumps into sound problems after the install, doesn't know how to fix it. Regularly breaks his OS by copying scripts from the internet or not being able to maintain the system (did anyone say dependency loop?). And as you can already guess, he gives up and decides that linux is not for everyone. Well, he is right but not entirely.

Linux, as we know, is open source. This makes the OS very much customizable to suite any device. The software that runs the mp3 player in your car, it's most probably Linux based. The kernel it's using has been customized to support only audio and audio interfaces, thus making it a very little compiled package that can be installed even on a 2 MB storage. This very well depicts one of the most important advantages of Linux. It doesn't demand any specific device to run on. This makes it happen that Linux based OS’ are available for almost every kind of users and devices which makes it the most used operating system. If you consider the proprietary options like Windows or Mac, these are the OS’ that are aimed to serve every kind of users with different backgrounds in tech or non tech through a single OS. Whereas the GNU/Linux is exactly the opposite, for every kind of users there's probably a Linux distro present to perfectly fit their requirements and don't forget that these can be customized even further. Coming to John's issue; you might have got it by now. The problem was that the distro he chose to install was not a good fit for him. There are many distros that don't require any kind of hassle to install (can be even simpler than windows), everything is handled graphically thorough GUI, be it software updates/installation, running your favorite program etc. Then there are distros that you need to build almost from scratch.

>Linux  is an open-source Unix-like operating system based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution.

<br>

These Linux distributions generally come together packaged with GNU packages and libraries. Thus [The Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) calls it GNU/Linux rather than just Linux. Linux is the just the kernel, rest of the OS is built around GNU.

>**Richard Stallman**: 
>Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux. 

For a better understanding of GNU’s contribution to Linux distributions, refer to this [link](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html).

## Why should you use Linux?

Don't worry, I'm not going to list those old ass reasons (though still hold true) that have been floating on the web for decades. You just search about Linux and definitely you'll find those facts in the top results. Like security, stability etc, and they are right. Instead, someday I'll maybe try to bring a detailed article on why Linux is more secure than the proprietary options, that'd be better I think. I'll talk about other important things in this article. Like freedom. If there's a synonym for freedom in the tech community, Linux would top my list. Linux is free, not only as price but also as freedom. With Linux you get absolute control over your system, from the choice of your softwares (even system services) to preferred kernel support and version. You can run it as you want. If you wish, change the source code to your liking, redistribute it. The limitations lie only within you. 

As I have already mentioned above, there are many distros available to try, with a bit of research I'm sure you will find the distro that exactly fits your purpose and the needs and that might not have been possible for you with windows ’til now (depends on the necessities). Neither you need to abide by any specific system specifications as there are distros available to run smoothly on even toasters.

### **Linux doesn't spy on you.**

When you've got windows on your computer, it's you who's the product. It is sending your data to Microsoft over telemetry and your data is being used so that they can earn more money. Linux or any other free software don't do that. Big tech companies are trying to shape our behaviors and habits (to make more profits) using the enormous data that they have about us, and they are getting successful. Unfortunately, most people don't care about it. You can take your first step today and start replacing proprietary softwares with the free softwares in your daily life (wherever possible and feasible) if you don't want to contribute to that scary future where big tech companies have absolute control over our lifestyle.
<br>
<br>

### **Productivity needs.**

You can customize your distro to your own taste of look and feel. Tiling window managers, terminal multiplexer, scripting languages to name a few give Linux its productivity superpowers. For example you can write your own bash script to load your preferred programs in exactly the way you want, exactly where you want them to be placed (maybe tiled) using just one command or maybe even just using a couple of key presses if you map it like that. It can be just a couple of programs or a several terminals with programs, it doesn't matter.     
<br>
<br>
The power of Linux lies within the community itself. It is the result of the community (users, developers, maintainers etc) contributing to it every day in one way or the other. Once you enter this community, you'll have many sudoers on the way to address your issues, questions and opinions in the forums, irc, social media and even in real life if you have Dave as your friend.
